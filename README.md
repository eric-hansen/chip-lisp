# chip-lisp
CHIP-8 emulator written in elisp

## Why?

Because I figured this would be a fun little project.  Even if I don't get the UI part implemented, it gives me experience in using Elisp more.

## What Is CHIP-8?

If you browse /r/emudev it's one of the most suggested systems to write an emulator for.  It's extremely basic (HAHA, get it... BASIC...basic...) and thus has a low barrier of entry.

Also, it's fun to think about CHIPs...because CHIP-8 it... ;)  Puns are fun.
